# Background & Motivation

The motivation for this project stemmed from two main sources. The first source was a very insightful conversation with an industry professinal at SMFR. During our conversation based on the dataset, we discussed the long term health affects on firefighters

# Data

The data used in this project comes directly from [South Metro Fire & Rescue](https://www.southmetro.org/) logs. Although the data is public information in order for me to obtain this data a [Open records request](https://www.southmetro.org/467/Open-Records-Requests). Following the request I was connected with a representative from SMFR who provided me aid.

The complete dataset consists of 26 different attributes of every 9-11 call recieved by SMFR during the 2019 year.
